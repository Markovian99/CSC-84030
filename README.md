# CSC-84030

This repository contains materials for the graduate course **Big Data Analytics**.

The course focuses on the **systems, tools, and design principles** used to store, process, and analyze large-scale data. Topics include distributed storage, batch and streaming analytics, graph analytics, scalable machine learning, and modern large-model data pipelines.

---

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository may evolve over the semester. Materials may include:

- Jupyter notebooks used for lectures, demos, and assignments
- Code examples and experiments
- Datasets or data access instructions
- Project guidelines and starter code

---

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

Toward the end of the course, we will study **large language models from a big data systems perspective**, focusing on data pipelines, scalability, and performance rather than model theory.

Students are **strongly encouraged** to browse the following repository early in the semester:

- https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat

You are *not* expected to understand all details immediately. Early exposure will make later discussions on data layout, training loops, and scaling behavior more intuitive when we revisit these topics in class.

---

## Getting Started

Specific setup instructions, dependencies, and assignment details will be provided as the course progresses.

If you are comfortable with Python and basic data analysis tools, you are well prepared for this course.

## Notes

This repository is intended to support learning and experimentation. Content may be updated throughout the semester to reflect pacing, feedback, or emerging topics.
